<p>Jekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written
  in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout
  or a series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data
  gets displayed in the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the
  final product.</p>
<p>A basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:</p>

<h2 id="front-matter">Front matter<a href="#front-matter" class="header-link">#</a></h2>
<p>The front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be
  processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form
  of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:</p>
<p>Between these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for a reference) or even create custom
  ones of your own. These variables will then be available to you to access using Liquid tags both further down in the
  file and also in any layouts or includes that the page or post in question relies on.</p>

<h2 id="where-additional-pages-live">Where additional pages live<a href="#where-additional-pages-live" class="header-link">#</a></h2>
<p>Where you put HTML or Markdown files for pages depends on how you want the pages to work. There are two main ways of
  creating pages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your site’s root folder.</li>
  <li>Place pages inside folders and subfolders named whatever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both methods work fine (and can be used in conjunction with each other), with the only real difference being the
  resulting URLs. By default, pages retain the same folder structure in <code class=" highlighter-rouge language-plaintext">_site</code> as they do in the source directory.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Cricket" /><category term="education" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The and room.
